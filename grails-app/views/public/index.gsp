    <h3>What is InfraViewer?</h3>
    <p>Infraviewer is designed for any organization that need to maintain physical infrastructure.  There are modules
    for projecting times for asset replacement, estimating status based on depreciation, budgeting, and soon
    for work order creation and contractor management.</p>
</br>   

    <h3>Who can use InfraViewer?</h3>
    <p>There is not a set domain.  InfraViewer is built with civil infrastructure management in mind, such as what
    you might find in any city or town- lighting, water and waste-water, signage, parks, road assets, sidewalks,
    buildings and building components, culverts and bridges, any so on. </p>
    <p>However, there are many applicable uses of InfraViewer; any large enterprise that needs to track and manage
    infrastructure, public, private, or hybrid, can find a use for InfraViewer.</p>
